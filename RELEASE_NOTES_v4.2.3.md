## 🎯 New Feature: Optional Cipher Integration

### What is Cipher?
[Cipher](https://github.com/campfirein/cipher) is an AI memory layer for coding agents that provides:
- Cross-IDE memory persistence (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
- Team knowledge sharing capabilities

### Implementation Highlights
- **Adapter Pattern**: Clean, optional integration that doesn't affect core functionality
- **Zero Dependencies**: Second Brain works perfectly without Cipher
- **Flexible Configuration**: Choose your integration level:
  - Solo developers: Use Second Brain standalone
  - AI-IDE users: Enable Cipher for IDE memory sync
  - Teams: Full bi-directional sync with workspace sharing

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Enable in .env
CIPHER_ENABLED=true
CIPHER_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional for teams
CIPHER_API_KEY=your-api-key
CIPHER_WORKSPACE_ID=team-workspace
```

## 📚 Documentation Overhaul

### Massive Cleanup
- **Removed:** 33+ redundant documentation files (27,000 lines)
- **Consolidated:** 16 CI/CD docs → 1 simple guide
- **Deleted:** All v3 legacy documentation
- **Simplified:** 2000+ line docs → concise, developer-friendly versions
