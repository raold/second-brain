## Summary Statistics:
- **Validated Benchmarks**: 2/4 (50%)
- **Average Correlation**: 68.5%
- **Target Success Rate**: 2/4 meeting >70% target
- **Research Status**: 2 complete, 1 testing, 1 researching

Each entry follows the consistent format from your template with:
- Experiment details and hypotheses
- Implementation code snippets
- Statistical analyses and results
- Current issues and next steps
- Literature connections
- Performance metrics

The entries reflect the actual status shown in your cognitive validity benchmarks screenshot, maintaining formatting consistency throughout.
