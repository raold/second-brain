# Change Audit - Production Hardening and Refactor

## Overview
This document tracks the changes, enhancements, and refactors applied to upgrade the LLM Output Processor from **Alpha** to **v1.0 Production**.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-14

### Added
- `.env.example` expanded with all configuration options including APP_ENV for CI/testing.
- `SECURITY.md` with policies and reporting guidelines.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with clear contribution and security disclosure guidelines.
- Docker Compose healthchecks for both API and Qdrant services.
- CI-safe defaults injected via `APP_ENV=ci` in docker-compose.yml.

### Changed
- Centralized configuration via `Config` class in `config.py`, including environment-aware defaults.
- `auth.py` now reads tokens from centralized config and logs invalid attempts.
- Token injection and mocking enabled in `test_ingest.py` and `test_search.py` for CI compatibility.
- Docker Compose networking explicitly configured to use a dedicated `app-net` bridge.

### Fixed
- Authentication failures in CI due to missing tokens.
- Broken Docker Compose volume paths and network configs.

### Upcoming
- Full mocking of external dependencies (OpenAI, Qdrant) in test suite.
- Metrics, monitoring, and rate limiting.
