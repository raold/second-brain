# Permanent Co-Authorship Disable Setup

This document explains how co-authorship is permanently disabled in this repository.

## Active Protections

### 1. Git Commit Hook (Active)
- **Location**: `.git/hooks/commit-msg`
- **Function**: Automatically removes any Co-Authored-By lines from every commit
- **Status**: ✅ Active and tested

### 2. CLAUDE.md Instructions (Active)
- **Location**: `CLAUDE.md`
- **Function**: Instructs Claude to never add co-author lines
- **Status**: ✅ Active

### 3. Optional Global Config
- **Location**: `.gitconfig.no-coauthor`
- **Function**: Can be included in global git config for system-wide protection
- **Setup**: `git config --global include.path /path/to/.gitconfig.no-coauthor`
- **Status**: ⏸️ Available but not required

## How It Works

Every time you make a commit:
1. Git runs the `commit-msg` hook
2. The hook searches for any lines matching "Co-Authored-By:" (case-insensitive)
3. All matching lines are automatically removed
4. The cleaned commit message is saved

## Testing

To verify it's working:
```bash
# Try to create a commit with co-authorship
git commit -m "Test commit

Co-Authored-By: Someone <someone@example.com>"

# Check the commit - co-author line will be gone
git log -1 --pretty=full
```

## Why This Matters

- User has explicitly requested no co-authorship multiple times
- This ensures compliance with user preferences
- Works automatically without manual intervention
- Cannot be accidentally overridden
