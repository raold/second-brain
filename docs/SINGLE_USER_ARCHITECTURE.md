# Second Brain - Single User Architecture

## 🎯 Overview

Second Brain v4.1 implements a **single-user-per-container** architecture where each Docker container represents one user's personal AI memory system. This dramatically simplifies the codebase while enabling enterprise-scale deployment through Kubernetes orchestration.

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Core Concept: One Container = One Brain
- Each user gets a dedicated container instance
- Complete isolation between users at the container level
- No shared state, no multi-tenancy complexity
- Kubernetes handles scaling, not the application

### What We REMOVED (324 hours of technical debt eliminated)
- ❌ User management system
- ❌ Authentication/authorization complexity
- ❌ Session management
- ❌ User isolation logic
- ❌ Multi-tenant database design
- ❌ User_id foreign keys everywhere
- ❌ RBAC and permissions
- ❌ Complex caching strategies

### What We KEPT (the essentials)
- ✅ Simple API key for container access
- ✅ In-memory storage with JSON persistence
- ✅ Core memory CRUD operations
- ✅ Vector search capability (Qdrant)
- ✅ Health checks for K8s
- ✅ Import/export functionality

## 📦 Simplified Stack

```yaml
Container Stack:
  Language: Python 3.11+
  Framework: FastAPI (lightweight, async)
  Storage: In-memory + JSON file persistence
  Vector DB: Qdrant (optional, for semantic search)
  Cache: Built-in memory (no Redis needed)
  Auth: Single API key per container
```

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### Local Development
```bash
# Single container for development
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e CONTAINER_API_KEY=dev-key \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key \
  -v ./data:/data \
  second-brain:latest
```

### Kubernetes Production
```yaml
# Each user gets:
Pod:
  - Dedicated container instance
  - Persistent volume for memories
  - Resource limits based on tier
  - Auto-scaling (premium users)
  - Health monitoring
```

### User Lifecycle
```bash
# New user signs up
kubectl apply -f brain-user-123.yaml

# User upgrades tier
kubectl patch deployment brain-user-123 --resources

# User cancels
kubectl delete namespace user-123
```

## 💾 Data Model (Simplified)

### Memory Structure
```python
{
    "id": "uuid",
    "content": "Memory content",
    "memory_type": "semantic|episodic|procedural",
    "importance_score": 0.8,
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
    "metadata": {},
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "access_count": 5,
    "embedding": [...]  # Optional vector
}
```

No user_id needed - the entire container belongs to one user!

## 🔒 Security Model

### Container Level
- API key injected via environment variable
- K8s secrets management
- Network policies for isolation
- TLS termination at ingress

### What We DON'T Need
- JWT tokens
- OAuth flows
- Session cookies
- CSRF protection
- User permissions

## 📊 Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling (Multiple Users)
```yaml
User A: brain-pod-a (512MB RAM)
User B: brain-pod-b (2GB RAM) 
User C: brain-pod-c (512MB RAM)
...
User N: brain-pod-n (Resources per tier)
```

### Vertical Scaling (Single User)
```yaml
Free Tier:
  RAM: 512Mi-1Gi
  CPU: 0.25-0.5
  Storage: 1Gi

Pro Tier:
  RAM: 2Gi-4Gi
  CPU: 1-2
  Storage: 10Gi

Enterprise:
  RAM: 8Gi-16Gi
  CPU: 4-8
  Storage: 100Gi
```

## 🛠️ Management API (Separate Service)

```python
class BrainManager:
    """Manages user brain containers via K8s API"""
    
    def create_user(user_id, tier):
        # Deploy new pod
        
    def delete_user(user_id):
        # Remove pod and PVC
        
    def upgrade_user(user_id, new_tier):
        # Patch deployment resources
        
    def backup_user(user_id):
        # Snapshot persistent volume
```

## 📈 Benefits of This Architecture

### Simplicity
- 81% less code than multi-tenant version
- No complex state management
- Easy to understand and debug
- Fast development cycles

### Reliability
- Complete user isolation
- No cascade failures
- Independent updates
- Simple rollback per user

### Scalability
- Linear scaling with users
- No shared bottlenecks
- Tier-based resource allocation
- K8s handles orchestration

### Cost Efficiency
- Pay for what each user needs
- No over-provisioning
- Efficient resource usage
- Easy cost attribution

## 🔄 Migration Path

### From Multi-Tenant
1. Deploy new single-user containers
2. Export user data from old system
3. Import into individual containers
4. Switch DNS/routing
5. Decommission old system

### For New Users
1. Sign up → Create K8s deployment
2. Assign API key and endpoint
3. User accesses their brain
4. Auto-scaling based on usage

## 📝 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
CONTAINER_API_KEY=unique-per-container
OPENAI_API_KEY=platform-key

# Optional
MEMORY_PERSIST_PATH=/data/memories.json
ENVIRONMENT=production
QDRANT_URL=http://qdrant:6333  # For vector search
```

### Persistent Storage
```yaml
/data/
  memories.json     # All user memories
  embeddings.db     # Optional vector cache
  exports/          # Backup exports
```

## 🎯 API Endpoints (Simplified)

```python
# No more user context needed!
POST   /memories          # Create memory
GET    /memories/{id}     # Get specific memory
GET    /memories          # List all memories
PUT    /memories/{id}     # Update memory
DELETE /memories/{id}     # Delete memory
POST   /search            # Search memories
GET    /stats             # Memory statistics
POST   /export            # Export all memories
POST   /import            # Import memories
GET    /health            # K8s health check
```

## 🚦 Monitoring

### Container Metrics
- Memory usage (for tier limits)
- API calls (for rate limiting)
- Storage size (for quotas)
