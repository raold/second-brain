# Development Context - Second Brain Project

> **Purpose**: Maintain session continuity and decision history across Claude instances
> **Created**: 2025-07-31
> **Last Updated**: 2025-07-31

## Current Session Context

### Active Development Focus
- Setting up Claude Code subagents for enterprise software engineering
- Implementing context-aware agents that use TODO.md and CLAUDE.md
- 27 specialized agents created across 8 categories

### Recent Decisions
1. **Agent Architecture**: Implemented specialized subagents for:
   - Code Analysis (3 agents)
   - Documentation (3 agents)
   - Technical Debt & Maintenance (3 agents)
   - Security & Compliance (2 agents)
   - Testing & Quality (3 agents)
   - DevOps & Operations (3 agents)
   - Team Collaboration (3 agents)
   - Integration & Orchestration (3 agents)

2. **Context Integration**: Extended agents to automatically read:
   - TODO.md for current project state
   - CLAUDE.md for core principles
   - This file for session continuity

3. **Auto-Activation**: Configured key agents to activate automatically in second-brain directory

### Session History

#### Session 2025-07-31
- Created comprehensive agent ecosystem (27 agents total)
- Implemented context-aware orchestrator and debt tracker
- Set up auto-activation configuration
- Integrated TODO.md and CLAUDE.md into agent workflows

### User Preferences Confirmed
- NO CO-AUTHOR LINES IN COMMITS
- Docker-first development approach
- Autonomous mode - no confirmations needed
- Enterprise-ready focus (current: 7/10, target: 10/10)

### Next Steps
- Test agent functionality with real tasks
- Monitor agent performance and token usage
- Refine context integration based on usage patterns
- Continue progress toward enterprise readiness 10/10

## Agent System Status

### Deployed Agents
- Original knowledge agents: 4
- Engineering-specific agents: 23
- Total: 27 agents

### Integration Points
- TODO.md: Primary task and state tracking
- CLAUDE.md: Core principles and patterns
- DEVELOPMENT_CONTEXT.md: Session history and decisions

### Performance Considerations
- Expected 15x token usage with multi-agent workflows
- Context files add ~2-3k tokens per agent invocation
- Optimize by selective context loading based on task
