- **Custom Templates**: Create reusable report configurations

#### Key Capabilities:
- Time-based analysis with flexible date ranges
- Metrics calculation (growth rate, retention, activity patterns)
- Topic distribution and knowledge mapping
- Actionable recommendations
- Visual representations (when HTML/PDF format selected)

### üîÑ Spaced Repetition System

Optimize your learning with scientifically-proven memory review algorithms:

- **3 Algorithms**: 
  - SuperMemo 2 (SM2) - The classic algorithm
  - Anki - Advanced with learning phases
  - Leitner Box System - Simple 5-box approach
- **Forgetting Curves**: Visual retention tracking
- **Review Sessions**: Structured review workflows
- **Learning Statistics**: Track your progress over time
- **Bulk Scheduling**: Schedule multiple memories at once
- **Custom Parameters**: Fine-tune algorithm behavior

#### Features:
- Optimal review time calculation
- Memory strength tracking
- Session-based reviews with statistics
- Overdue memory prioritization
- Confidence level tracking

### üîå WebSocket Real-time Updates

Stay connected with instant notifications:

- **15+ Event Types**: Memory operations, reviews, reports, system events
- **Pattern Subscriptions**: Subscribe to event patterns (e.g., "memory.*")
- **Event Filtering**: Custom filters for targeted updates
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and cleanup
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 events/second per connection
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Monitor WebSocket performance

#### Supported Events:
- Memory: created, updated, deleted, archived
- Review: scheduled, due, completed, skipped
- Report: started, progress, completed, failed
- System: alerts, updates, connection status

- Integration tests for complete workflows
- WebSocket protocol testing

## üìà Performance Metrics

- Report generation: < 5s for monthly reports
- WebSocket latency: < 100ms
- Review scheduling: < 50ms
- Memory efficiency: Optimized data structures

## üîß Configuration

New configuration options in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
synthesis:
  report_generation:
    enabled: true
    ai_summaries: true
    gpt4_api_key: ${GPT4_API_KEY}
    max_summary_length: 500
    
  spaced_repetition:
    enabled: true
    default_algorithm: sm2
    review_notification: true
    
  websocket:
    enabled: true
    max_connections_per_user: 5
