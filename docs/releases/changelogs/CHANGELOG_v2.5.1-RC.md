# Changelog - v2.5.1-RC

## AI-Powered Insights & Pattern Discovery

### Release Date: 2025-07-21 (Release Candidate)

## Major Features

### AI-Powered Insights Engine
- Automatically generate personalized insights from memory patterns
- Time-frame based analysis (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, all-time)
- Confidence scoring and impact assessment for each insight
- Intelligent recommendation system based on usage patterns

### Pattern Detection System
- **Temporal Patterns**: Discover when you're most active and productive
- **Semantic Patterns**: Find conceptual connections between memories
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Understand your learning and access habits
- **Structural Patterns**: Identify organizational patterns in your knowledge
- **Evolutionary Patterns**: Track how your interests change over time

### Memory Clustering
- Three clustering algorithms:
  - K-means for defined cluster counts
  - DBSCAN for density-based discovery
  - Hierarchical for nested relationships
- Automatic cluster naming and description
- Coherence scoring for cluster quality

### Knowledge Gap Analysis
- AI-driven identification of missing knowledge areas
- Domain coverage assessment
- Personalized learning path recommendations
- Severity scoring for prioritization

### Learning Progress Tracking
- Topic mastery level calculation
- Knowledge retention scoring
- Learning velocity metrics
- Achievement tracking system
- Improvement area identification

### Interactive Insights Dashboard
