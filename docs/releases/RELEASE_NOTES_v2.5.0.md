2. **Sophisticated Ingestion Engine** - Intelligent content processing with NLP-powered extraction of entities, topics, relationships, and structured data

## 📋 What's New

### 🤖 AI-Powered Insights Engine

Transform your memory collection into actionable intelligence:

- **Automatic Insight Generation**: Discover patterns you didn't know existed
- **5 Pattern Types**: Temporal, semantic, behavioral, structural, and evolutionary patterns
- **3 Clustering Algorithms**: K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering for intelligent memory grouping
- **Knowledge Gap Analysis**: Identify missing areas in your knowledge base with AI recommendations
- **Learning Progress Tracking**: Monitor knowledge growth and mastery levels over time
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Beautiful visualizations of all discoveries and analytics

#### Key Features:
- Pattern detection across multiple dimensions
- Automated insight generation with personalized recommendations
- Memory clustering for discovering related content
- Knowledge gap identification and learning suggestions
- Progress tracking with mastery metrics
- Real-time analytics dashboard

### 🎯 Sophisticated Ingestion Engine

Never manually tag or categorize content again:

- **Entity Extraction (NER)**: Automatically identify people, places, dates, organizations, and custom entities
- **Topic Modeling**: Discover themes using LDA and keyword-based classification
- **Relationship Detection**: Find connections between entities using dependency parsing
- **Intent Recognition**: Understand if content is a question, TODO, idea, or decision
- **Automatic Embeddings**: Generate vector embeddings for semantic search
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Extract tables, lists, code snippets, and key-value pairs
- **Content Classification**: Automatic quality assessment and domain detection
- **Streaming Architecture**: Real-time async processing with batching support

#### Key Components:
- 11 modular ingestion components
- Async streaming pipeline
- Advanced validation framework
- Preprocessing and normalization
- Multi-level quality assessment
- Extensible architecture

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Enable AI Insights

Access the insights dashboard:
```
http://localhost:8000/static/insights-dashboard.html
```

Use the API:
```python
# Generate insights for the last month
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/insights/generate",
    json={"time_frame": "monthly"},
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your-token"}
)
```

### 2. Use the Ingestion Engine

```python
from app.ingestion.entity_extractor import EntityExtractor
from app.ingestion.topic_classifier import TopicClassifier

# Extract entities
extractor = EntityExtractor()
entities = extractor.extract_entities("Meeting with John Smith at OpenAI tomorrow")

# Classify topics
classifier = TopicClassifier()
topics = classifier.extract_topics("Machine learning research on neural networks")
```

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed emoji encoding issues in session manager for Windows compatibility
- Updated mock database for insights support
- Fixed Pydantic v2 compatibility issues
- Resolved test data format mismatches
- Fixed import errors in relationship detector
- Corrected version consistency across all files
