**Before:** 22 vulnerabilities (6 high, 15 moderate, 1 low)  
**After:** Significantly reduced attack surface

- âœ… All HIGH severity vulnerabilities patched
- âœ… Most MODERATE vulnerabilities addressed
- âœ… App tested and working with updates

### Testing Performed

```bash
# App imports successfully
âœ… from app.app import app

# API starts without errors
âœ… V2 API dependencies ready
âœ… V2 API routes included

# Core functionality maintained
âœ… PostgreSQL connections work
âœ… FastAPI endpoints responsive
```

### Breaking Changes

None - This is a security patch with backward compatibility maintained.

### Upgrade Instructions

```bash
# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install updated dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

# Restart your application
```

### Remaining Work

Some dependencies couldn't be updated to latest versions due to compatibility:
- numpy/pandas/scikit-learn (need coordinated update)
- Some minor dependencies

These will be addressed in v4.3.0 with a more comprehensive dependency overhaul.

### Verification

To verify the security updates:

```bash
pip list | grep -E "(cryptography|jinja2|pypdf|certifi)"
```

Should show:
- cryptography 45.0.6+
- Jinja2 3.1.6+
- pypdf 5.9.0+
- certifi 2025.8.3+
