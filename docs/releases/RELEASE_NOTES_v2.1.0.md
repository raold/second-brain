# üß† Second Brain v2.1.0 - Cognitive Memory Classification

## üìã Release Overview

**Version**: v2.1.0 (Cognitive)  
**Release Date**: December 15, 2024  
**Focus**: Memory Type Classification & Intelligent Organization  
**Codename**: Cognitive  

## üéØ Key Features

Second Brain v2.1.0 introduces **intelligent memory type classification**, bringing cognitive science principles to digital memory management. This release implements the three core memory types from neuroscience: semantic, episodic, and procedural memory.

### üß© Memory Type Classification Engine

- **Semantic Memory**: Facts, concepts, and general knowledge
- **Episodic Memory**: Personal experiences and events with temporal context
- **Procedural Memory**: Skills, procedures, and how-to knowledge
- **Contextual Memory**: Location and context-aware information

### üéØ Intelligent Classification

- **Automatic Classification**: AI-powered categorization of incoming memories
- **Context Analysis**: Understanding when and where memories were formed
- **Temporal Relationships**: Connecting memories across time periods
- **Semantic Clustering**: Grouping related concepts and knowledge

### üîç Enhanced Search Capabilities

- **Type-Specific Search**: Filter by memory type for precise results
- **Contextual Search**: Find memories based on context and situation
- **Temporal Queries**: Search memories by time periods and events
- **Cross-Reference Discovery**: Find connections between different memory types
