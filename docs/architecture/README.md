- **Advanced indexing** for optimal performance

### 2. Simplicity & Reliability
- **Minimal moving parts** for reduced complexity
- **Async/await patterns** for high concurrency
- **Connection pooling** for resource efficiency
- **Comprehensive error handling** for reliability

### 3. Modular Organization
- **Clean separation** of concerns across modules
- **Service layer** for business logic isolation
- **Repository pattern** for data access abstraction
- **Route handlers** for API endpoint organization

### 4. Quality & Maintainability
- **Comprehensive testing** strategy (unit, integration, performance)
- **Professional documentation** standards
- **Semantic versioning** for release management
- **Code review** processes for quality assurance
