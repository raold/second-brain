# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Second Brain project. ADRs document significant architectural decisions, their context, alternatives considered, and consequences.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the project's development. They help:

- Document the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Provide context for future developers
- Track the evolution of system architecture
- Support decision-making processes
- Create institutional knowledge

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standard format:

- **Title**: Brief description of the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: The choice that was made
- **Consequences**: The results of the decision (positive, negative, neutral)
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated

## Current ADRs

### Active Decisions

| ADR | Title | Date | Status | Impact |
|-----|-------|------|--------|--------|
| [ADR-001](adr-001-cicd-system-redesign.md) | CI/CD System Redesign - Speed-Optimized Tiered Pipeline | 2025-08-01 | Accepted | High |

### Decision Categories

#### Infrastructure & DevOps
- **ADR-001**: CI/CD System Redesign - Transformed failing pipeline (90% failure rate) into enterprise-grade tiered system

#### Data & Storage
- *Future ADRs will be added here*

#### API & Integration
- *Future ADRs will be added here*

#### Security & Compliance
- *Future ADRs will be added here*

#### Performance & Scalability
- *Future ADRs will be added here*

## ADR Lifecycle

### Creating a New ADR

1. **Identify the Decision**: Recognize when an architectural decision needs documentation
2. **Research Alternatives**: Investigate multiple approaches and their trade-offs
3. **Draft the ADR**: Use the standard template to document context, decision, and consequences
4. **Review Process**: Get input from relevant stakeholders
5. **Finalize**: Mark as "Accepted" and implement the decision

### Updating ADRs

- **Status Changes**: Update status when decisions are superseded or deprecated
- **Consequence Updates**: Add new consequences as they become apparent
- **Reference Links**: Keep references current and add new relevant resources

### ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-[NUMBER]: [TITLE]

Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]

## Context

[Describe the issue motivating this decision, and any context that influences or constrains the decision.]

## Decision

[Describe our response to these forces. State the decision in full sentences, with active voice. "We will..."]

## Consequences

[Describe the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones.]

### Positive
- [Consequence 1]
- [Consequence 2]

### Negative
- [Consequence 1]
- [Consequence 2]

### Neutral
- [Consequence 1]
- [Consequence 2]

## Alternatives Considered

[List the alternatives considered and why they were not chosen]

## References

- [Link to relevant documentation]
- [Link to discussion thread]
- [Link to similar decisions in other projects]
```

## Best Practices

### When to Write an ADR

- Choosing core technologies (databases, frameworks, services)
- Significant architectural pattern changes
- Major integration decisions
- Security architecture choices
- Performance optimization strategies
- Scalability decisions
- Development workflow changes

### Writing Guidelines

1. **Be Objective**: Present alternatives fairly without bias
2. **Include Context**: Explain the circumstances that led to the decision
3. **Document Trade-offs**: Be honest about what you're giving up
4. **Think Long-term**: Consider how the decision will age
5. **Link Extensively**: Connect to related decisions and resources
6. **Update Regularly**: Keep consequences current as they evolve

### Common ADR Mistakes

- Writing ADRs after the fact (retroactive justification)
- Not documenting alternatives that were considered
- Focusing only on positive consequences
- Using overly technical language without business context
- Not updating ADRs when circumstances change

## ADR History

### 2025
- **August 2025**: First ADR created for CI/CD system redesign following pipeline failure crisis

## Contributing to ADRs

### Proposing a New ADR

1. Check if a similar decision already exists
2. Draft using the standard template
3. Submit as a pull request
4. Participate in review discussions
5. Update based on feedback

### Reviewing ADRs

- Focus on completeness of context and alternatives
- Verify that consequences are realistic and comprehensive
- Ensure the decision is clearly stated and actionable
- Check that references are accurate and relevant

### Maintaining ADRs

- Monitor implementation outcomes
- Update consequences as they become apparent
- Link new ADRs to related existing ones
- Deprecate or supersede when appropriate

---

**Remember**: ADRs are living documents that evolve with the system. They should be updated as new information becomes available and consequences become clear through implementation experience.
