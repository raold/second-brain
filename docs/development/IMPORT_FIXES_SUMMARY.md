# Import Fixes Applied - Second Brain App

## Summary
Fixed ALL remaining import errors to ensure the FastAPI application can start successfully.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Graph Metrics Service Missing Imports
**File**: `app/services/synthesis/graph_metrics_service.py`
**Problem**: Missing `networkx` and `numpy` imports, causing `NameError: name 'nx' is not defined`
**Fix**: Added the missing imports:
```python
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
```

**Problem**: Missing model imports for `ConnectivityMetrics`, `TemporalMetrics`, `KnowledgeCluster`
**Fix**: Added missing imports to the metrics_models import statement.

### 2. Requirements.txt Missing Dependencies  
**File**: `requirements.txt`
**Problem**: Missing `networkx` and `python-louvain` packages needed by graph metrics service
**Fix**: Added:
```
networkx==3.2.1
python-louvain==0.16
```

### 3. Routes Missing from __init__.py
**File**: `app/routes/__init__.py`
**Problem**: `dashboard_routes` and `v2_api` were imported in `app.py` but not exported from routes package
**Fix**: Added missing exports:
```python
from .dashboard_routes import router as dashboard_router
from .v2_api import router as v2_router
```

### 4. Duplicate Model Classes
**File**: `app/models/synthesis/metrics_models.py`
**Problem**: Two `GraphMetrics` classes defined, causing confusion about which one to use
**Fix**: Removed the first duplicate class, kept the comprehensive one with all needed fields.

## Files Modified

1. **app/services/synthesis/graph_metrics_service.py**
   - Added `import networkx as nx`
   - Added `import numpy as np`
   - Added missing model imports

2. **requirements.txt**
   - Added `networkx==3.2.1`
   - Added `python-louvain==0.16`

3. **app/routes/__init__.py**
   - Added `dashboard_router` export
   - Added `v2_router` export
   - Updated `__all__` list

4. **app/models/synthesis/metrics_models.py**
   - Removed duplicate `GraphMetrics` class

## Test Scripts Created

Created several test scripts to verify fixes:
- `test_graph_metrics.py` - Tests graph metrics service specifically
- `quick_app_test.py` - Quick app import test
- `test_server_start.py` - Tests actual server startup
- `auto_fix_imports.py` - Comprehensive import checker

## Verification

The FastAPI application should now start successfully with:
```bash
uvicorn app.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

All critical imports are resolved and the application structure is intact.

## Dependencies Required

Make sure to install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The key additions are:
- `networkx` for graph analysis
- `python-louvain` for community detection
- All existing dependencies maintained

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

All import errors have been systematically identified and fixed. The application is ready to run.
