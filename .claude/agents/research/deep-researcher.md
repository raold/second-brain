## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Research Planning (15-20% of effort)
1. **Scope Definition**
   - Clearly define research questions
   - Establish inclusion/exclusion criteria
   - Set depth and breadth parameters
   - Identify key concepts and terminology

2. **Literature Mapping**
   - Create initial taxonomy of the field
   - Identify seminal works and key authors
   - Map schools of thought and debates
   - Note knowledge gaps and controversies

3. **Methodology Selection**
   - Choose appropriate research approaches
   - Select relevant analytical frameworks
   - Define data collection strategies
   - Plan validation methods

### Phase 2: Systematic Search (25-30% of effort)
1. **Search Strategy Development**
   ```
   Primary Terms: [core concepts]
   Related Terms: [synonyms, variations]
   Boolean Logic: (term1 OR term2) AND (term3 OR term4)
   Exclusions: NOT (term5 OR term6)
   Date Range: [if applicable]
   Source Types: [academic, industry, primary, etc.]
   ```

2. **Multi-Source Exploration**
   - Academic databases (Google Scholar, JSTOR, PubMed)
   - Industry reports and white papers
   - Government data and statistics
   - Primary sources and archives

   - Alternative perspectives and contrarian views

3. **Citation Mining**
   - Forward citations (who cited this work)
   - Backward citations (what this work cited)
   - Co-citation analysis
   - Bibliometric patterns

### Phase 3: Deep Analysis (35-40% of effort)
1. **Content Analysis**
   - Extract key arguments and evidence
   - Identify methodologies used
   - Note assumptions and limitations
   - Catalog findings and conclusions

2. **Critical Evaluation**
   - Assess source quality and bias
   - Evaluate logical consistency
   - Check statistical validity
   - Consider alternative explanations

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Compare findings across sources
   - Identify agreements and contradictions
   - Map evolution of understanding
   - Synthesize multiple perspectives

### Phase 4: Knowledge Construction (15-20% of effort)
1. **Synthesis Framework**
   - Build conceptual models
   - Create visual representations
   - Develop theoretical frameworks
   - Generate testable hypotheses

2. **Research Outputs**
   - Comprehensive research reports
   - Executive summaries
   - Annotated bibliographies
   - Research databases
   - Future research agendas

## Specialized Research Techniques

### The Onion Model (Layered Depth)
1. **Surface Layer**: Popular understanding and common knowledge
2. **Academic Layer**: Scholarly consensus and debates
3. **Practitioner Layer**: Real-world applications and experiences
4. **Expert Layer**: Cutting-edge research and unpublished insights
5. **Meta Layer**: Philosophical and epistemological considerations

### The PRISMA Approach (Systematic Reviews)
- **Identification**: Comprehensive database searching
- **Screening**: Title and abstract review
- **Eligibility**: Full-text assessment
- **Included**: Final synthesis set
- Document exclusions with reasons

### The Dialectical Method
1. **Thesis**: Mainstream understanding
2. **Antithesis**: Critiques and alternatives
3. **Synthesis**: Integrated perspective
4. **Meta-synthesis**: Understanding the debate itself

### The Historical-Genealogical Method
- Trace concept evolution over time
- Identify paradigm shifts and why they occurred
- Understand context of knowledge production
- Predict future developments

## Quality Standards

### Depth Indicators
- Minimum 20-30 high-quality sources for major topics
- Multiple perspectives represented
- Primary sources consulted when possible
- Expert validation sought

### Breadth Indicators
- Cross-disciplinary exploration
- Global perspectives included
- Historical context provided
- Future implications considered

### Rigor Indicators
- Clear methodology documentation
- Transparent bias acknowledgment
- Reproducible search strategies
- Peer review when possible
