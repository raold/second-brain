# ðŸš¨ GitHub Pages Setup Required

GitHub Pages is **NOT ENABLED** in your repository settings.

## To Enable GitHub Pages:

1. **Go here NOW:** https://github.com/raold/second-brain/settings/pages

2. Under **"Build and deployment"**, set:
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `main` 
   - **Folder:** `/docs`
   
3. Click **"Save"**

4. Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment

5. Visit: https://raold.github.io/second-brain/

## What We've Done:

âœ… Created a simple, static HTML page (no complex dependencies)
âœ… Removed all Swagger/OpenAPI complexity
âœ… Tested locally - it works perfectly
âœ… Professional looking landing page with all project info
âœ… Clean `/docs` folder structure

## The Problem:

GitHub Pages needs to be **manually enabled** in your repository settings. This is a one-time setup that only you (the repo owner) can do.

## Test Locally:

```bash
cd docs
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Open: http://localhost:8080/
```

The page is ready and working. You just need to flip the switch in GitHub settings!
