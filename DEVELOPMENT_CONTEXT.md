# Development Context - Second Brain v4.0.0

## 🔄 Session History

### Session 2 - August 2, 2025 (Continued)
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Focus**: Test fixes, security audit, environment cleanup

#### What Happened
1. **Started with failing tests** (27/28 passing)
   - WebSocket tests couldn't import synthesis models
   - Created 13 model stub files to fix imports
   - Tests improved to 55 passing

2. **Security audit requested by user**
   - Found exposed API keys in `.env.development`
   - Removed keys immediately
   - Created comprehensive security infrastructure
   - Untracked sensitive files from git

3. **Environment cleanup requested**
   - User: "there are so many .envs example staging test development etc."
   - Deleted all redundant env files
   - Created unified `.env.example` template
   - Implemented robust `env_manager.py`

#### Decisions Made
- Use stub models for synthesis features (implement later as needed)
- Single `.env.example` template (no more multiple env files)
- Custom env_manager instead of python-dotenv
- Security-first approach with automated scanning

### Session 1 - August 2, 2025
**Duration**: ~3 hours  
**Focus**: Major cleanup and documentation

#### What Happened
1. **Massive directory cleanup**
   - Removed 327 files (83,304 lines)
   - Deleted: archive/, cipher/, demos/, dev-tools/
   - Consolidated 80+ scripts to 3

2. **Documentation overhaul**
   - Updated README.md to v4.0.0
   - Rewrote CLAUDE.md for clarity
   - Created comprehensive TODO.md

3. **Fixed import issues**
   - Created `service_factory.py`
   - Added stub services for tests

#### Key Decisions
- Keep v4.0.0 simple and clean
- Remove all unnecessary complexity
- Focus on core functionality

## 📐 Architectural Decisions

### Why V4.0.0?
- V3 had 500+ files with 80% unused code
- Circular dependencies everywhere
- Multiple API versions causing confusion
- Decision: **Start fresh with minimal, working core**

### Why Mock Database Fallback?
- User wants to develop without PostgreSQL setup
- Tests can run without external dependencies
- Decision: **Always support mock mode for development**

### Why `_new` Suffix?
- Transitional naming during v3→v4 migration
- Avoids conflicts with old modules
- Decision: **Keep for now, rename in future cleanup**

### Why Single ENV Template?
- Multiple env files caused confusion
- Hard to track which settings go where
- Decision: **One template, one local file, clear and simple**

### Why Custom env_manager?
- python-dotenv adds unnecessary dependency
- Need type-safe access to env vars
- Want validation and production checks
- Decision: **Build minimal, focused solution**

## 👤 User Preferences & Patterns

### Communication Style
- User prefers **direct action** over discussion
- Frustrated by repetitive confirmations
- Wants **autonomous execution**
- Example: "once and for all, lets figure out..."

### Development Philosophy
- **Ship working code** - functionality over perfection
- **Iterate based on usage** - don't over-engineer
- **Avoid premature optimization** - YAGNI principle
- **Clean and simple** - remove complexity

### Git Workflow
- No co-author attribution in commits
- Direct commit and push without confirmation
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Conventional commit format

### Testing Approach
- Fix tests pragmatically (stubs OK for now)
- Focus on core functionality tests
- Don't block on perfect coverage

---

## 🔧 Technical Context

### Current Stack
```yaml
Python: 3.11+
FastAPI: 0.104.1
Pydantic: 2.5.3
PostgreSQL: 16+ (optional)
Redis: (optional)

Key Libraries:
- SQLAlchemy: 2.0.23
- pytest: 7.4.3
- uvicorn: 0.24.0
```

### API Structure
- **ONLY V2 API** at `/api/v2/*`
- No V1, no multiple versions
- Single implementation in `v2_api_new.py`

### Service Architecture
```python
# All services use factory pattern
from app.services.service_factory import get_memory_service
service = get_memory_service()

# Never direct instantiation
# service = MemoryService()  # ❌ Wrong
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Minimal required for development
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Everything else has defaults
USE_MOCK_DATABASE=false  # Set true if no PostgreSQL
```

---

## 🚨 Critical Information

### Security Status
- **API Keys Were Exposed** in `.env.development`
- Now removed and replaced with placeholders
- User must rotate keys if they were real
- Security scanner implemented

### Test Status
```
Basic Tests: 27/28 passing (1 skipped)
WebSocket Tests: 28/39 passing (11 validation issues)
Total: 55 tests passing
```

### Known Technical Debt
1. Module names with `_new` suffix
2. Synthesis services are stubs
3. WebSocket model validation issues
4. Events and insights are minimal stubs

---

## 🎯 Next Session Starting Point

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Check if user rotated API keys** (security critical)
2. **Verify `.env` setup** for local development
3. **Run test suite** to confirm current state

### Quick Status Check
```bash
# Check git state
git status

# Run security scan
python scripts/check_secrets.py

# Run tests
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_basic_functionality.py -v

# Check env setup
ls -la | grep "\.env"
```

### Priority Tasks (from TODO.md)
1. Production deployment setup
2. Rename `_new` files (technical debt)
3. Implement real synthesis services
4. Fix WebSocket test failures
