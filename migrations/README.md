# Database Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic.

## Usage

### Create a new migration

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

### Apply migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback migrations

```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

### View migration history

```bash
alembic history
```

## Migration naming convention

Migrations are named with a timestamp and description:
- `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_description_of_changes.py`

## Important notes

1. Always review autogenerated migrations before applying
2. Test migrations on a development database first
3. Back up production data before running migrations
4. Never edit already-applied migrations
