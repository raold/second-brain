# TODO - Second Brain v4.2.3

## üî• CURRENT FOCUS: Token Persistence (Session 8)

### IMMEDIATE - Must Fix Now!
- [ ] **Fix Token Persistence** - Tokens lost on every restart!
  - [ ] Create `.gdrive_tokens.json` for local storage
  - [ ] Add encryption using Fernet (cryptography library)
  - [ ] Add `.gdrive_tokens.json` to `.gitignore`
  - [ ] Load tokens on startup if file exists
  - [ ] Test persistence across server restarts

- [ ] **Implement Token Refresh Logic**
  - [ ] Check token expiry before API calls
  - [ ] Auto-refresh using refresh token
  - [ ] Update stored tokens after refresh
  - [ ] Handle refresh failures gracefully

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Session 7 (Aug 15, 2025) - Google Drive Integration
- [x] Real OAuth flow implementation
- [x] File listing from Google Drive  
- [x] File sync to PostgreSQL as memories
- [x] Beautiful UI at `/static/gdrive-ui.html`
- [x] Code quality fixes (10/10 linting score)
- [x] Repository cleanup (removed 17 temp files)
- [x] Fixed CI/CD tests (added redis dependency)
- [x] PEP8 compliance (black, isort, flake8)

### Session 6 (Aug 9, 2025) - Documentation Overhaul
- [x] Documentation overhaul - removed 33+ redundant docs
- [x] Consolidated CI/CD documentation (16 ‚Üí 1)
- [x] Removed all v3 legacy documentation
- [x] Simplified API docs (2000+ lines ‚Üí concise)
- [x] Organized docs into proper subdirectories
- [x] Security patches for 22 vulnerabilities
- [x] Version bump to 4.2.3

## üìã BACKLOG

### High Priority
- [ ] **Production Security**
  - [ ] Generate strong encryption key (not "test-encryption-key")
  - [ ] Implement token rotation strategy
  - [ ] Add audit logging for OAuth events
  
- [ ] **PostgreSQL Production**
  - [ ] Test PostgreSQL + pgvector thoroughly
  - [ ] Set up proper connection pooling
  - [ ] Add database migrations

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **User Experience**
  - [ ] Progress indicators for large file syncs
  - [ ] Batch processing UI improvements
  - [ ] File type filtering (docs, pdfs, etc.)
  - [ ] Search within Google Drive files

- [ ] **Performance**
  - [ ] Implement file content caching
  - [ ] Optimize embedding generation
  - [ ] Parallel file processing
  - [ ] Rate limiting for Google API

### Low Priority
- [ ] Remove `_new` suffix from module names (technical debt)
- [ ] Implement remaining synthesis services (some are stubs)
- [ ] Add authentication/authorization for multi-user
- [ ] Create user documentation/video tutorials

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

### Critical (Blocks Usage)
- **Token Persistence**: Lost on every restart - user must re-auth
- **No Refresh Logic**: Access tokens expire after 1 hour

### Minor
- Python 3.13 compatibility (numpy, pandas don't support yet)
- HTML error responses could be cleaner
- No progress feedback during large syncs
- Mock OpenAI key limits embedding functionality

## üìä CURRENT STATE

### What Works ‚úÖ
- Google OAuth flow complete
- 100+ files accessible from Drive
- Files sync to PostgreSQL
- Beautiful UI interface
- All tests passing (28/28)
- Code quality 10/10

### What's Broken ‚ùå
- Tokens don't persist (IN MEMORY ONLY)
- No automatic token refresh
- Must re-authenticate on every restart

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### For Session 8 Completion
1. [ ] Tokens persist across server restarts
2. [ ] No manual re-authentication needed
3. [ ] Refresh tokens work automatically
4. [ ] Tokens encrypted on disk
5. [ ] `.gitignore` prevents token commits

### For Production Ready
1. [x] All tests passing
2. [ ] Security best practices implemented
3. [ ] Docker deployment working
4. [x] Documentation complete
5. [ ] 1 week of stable operation

## üí° TOKEN STORAGE PLAN

### Architecture Decision
```python
# Store in: .gdrive_tokens.json (git-ignored)
{
    "access_token": "encrypted_with_fernet",
    "refresh_token": "encrypted_with_fernet", 
    "token_expiry": "2025-08-15T12:00:00Z",
    "user_email": "dro@lynchburgsmiles.com"
}
```

### Security Model
- Encrypt with Fernet using `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from `.env`
- Never store plaintext tokens
- File permissions 600 (user read/write only)
- Add to `.gitignore` immediately
- Validate token integrity on load

## üìù NOTES

### User Requirements
- **"I want to actually use this fucking thing"** ‚úÖ
- Need seamless experience (no constant re-auth)
- Security important but UX critical
- Single user setup (no multi-tenant needed)
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Technical Constraints
- PostgreSQL ONLY (no SQLite, Redis, Qdrant)
- Production ready, not demos
- Autonomous mode (no confirmations)
- Docker deployment target

## üöÄ NEXT ACTIONS

1. **RIGHT NOW**: Implement token persistence with encryption
2. **TODAY**: Add refresh token logic
3. **THIS WEEK**: Test full flow with restarts
4. **THIS MONTH**: Deploy to production Docker
