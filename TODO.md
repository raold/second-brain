## 🔄 Recent Changes & Decisions

### Current Session (2025-07-27 - v3.0.0 Release & Post-Release)
- **MILESTONE: v3.0.0 Released!** 🎉
- Fixed final 8 test failures using WSL2 for Linux compatibility testing
- Achieved 430 passing tests, 0 failures (CI/CD green)
- Fixed Docker deployment issues:
  - Database connection (DATABASE_URL env var)
  - Redis client (replaced aioredis with redis.asyncio)
  - API tokens configuration
  - Cache directory permissions
- Created comprehensive Docker validation tests
- Set up CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Added CD badge to README
- Updated all documentation for v3.0.0
- **User preference noted**: No co-author lines in commits
- **Post-Release Enhancement**: Created custom brain-themed favicon
  - SVG with animated neural connections
  - Web manifest for PWA support
  - Favicon generator script for PNG versions
  - Already integrated in app.py and index.html
- **Favicon Redesign**: Updated to pink brain theme
  - Anatomically inspired pink brain (#ff6b9d)
  - Golden AI neural nodes for tech element
  - Simplified versions for small sizes
  - Updated theme colors in manifest
- **✅ Favicon Transparency Fix**: Updated all favicon variants with transparent backgrounds
  - Removed solid backgrounds from favicon.svg, favicon-simple.svg, favicon-16.svg
  - Enhanced stroke outlines and node visibility for better contrast
  - Updated favicon-demo.html with transparency showcase
  - Maintains compatibility with light and dark themes
  - Ready for enterprise deployment across different browser environments
- **✅ Enterprise Load Testing Suite**: Comprehensive performance testing framework
  - Created advanced load testing with multiple scenarios (baseline, concurrent, stress, endurance, spike, memory leak)
  - Enhanced existing performance benchmarks to v3.0.0
  - Added performance testing orchestrator script with CI/CD integration
  - Supports configurable test intensities (basic, moderate, intensive)
  - Generates detailed reports with performance grades and recommendations
  - Integrated with Makefile: `make perf-test`, `make load-test`, `make benchmark`
  - Enterprise-ready with resource monitoring and failure detection

### WSL2 Testing Strategy (Critical Learning)
- After 2 weeks of CI failures, discovered WSL2 as solution
- Windows-only testing missed Linux-specific issues
- Now testing in WSL2 matches GitHub Actions environment perfectly

### Previous Session (2025-01-26)
- Reduced test failures from 90+ to 22 to 8 to 0
- Fixed cross-platform compatibility issues
- Standardized on pathlib.Path for OS-agnostic paths

### Recent Commits Analysis
- `c2deda5`: Security audit implementation ✅
- `8a6a4d7`: Logging/monitoring system ✅
- `fd5795b`: Error handling system ✅
- `40d0f49`: Dependency injection standardization ✅

## 🗂️ Key File Locations

### Configuration
- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code settings
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions and principles
- `config/requirements-v3.txt` - Current dependencies

### Critical Code Areas
- `app/services/` - Business logic (uses DI pattern)
- `app/ingestion/` - Needs TODO cleanup
- `scripts/test_runner.py` - Main test orchestrator
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration

### Documentation
- `docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_V3.md` - Deployment guide
- `docs/testing/TESTING_GUIDE_V3.md` - Testing strategy
- `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE_v3.0.0.md` - Dev guide

## 🎨 Architectural Decisions

### Must Follow
1. **Docker-first**: All development uses containers
2. **Dependency Injection**: Use `get_*_service()` factories
3. **Testing Layers**: validation → unit → integration → e2e
4. **Error Handling**: Service-level with proper logging

### Never Do
1. Direct service instantiation (always use factories)
2. Business logic in route handlers
3. Bare exceptions without context
4. Global Python package installs
