  - Added performance testing orchestrator script with CI/CD integration
  - Supports configurable test intensities (basic, moderate, intensive)
  - Generates detailed reports with performance grades and recommendations
  - Integrated with Makefile: `make perf-test`, `make load-test`, `make benchmark`
  - Enterprise-ready with resource monitoring and failure detection

### WSL2 Testing Strategy (Critical Learning)
- After 2 weeks of CI failures, discovered WSL2 as solution
- Windows-only testing missed Linux-specific issues
- Now testing in WSL2 matches GitHub Actions environment perfectly

### Previous Session (2025-01-26)
- Reduced test failures from 90+ to 22 to 8 to 0
- Fixed cross-platform compatibility issues
- Standardized on pathlib.Path for OS-agnostic paths

### Recent Commits Analysis
- `c2deda5`: Security audit implementation ✅
- `8a6a4d7`: Logging/monitoring system ✅
- `fd5795b`: Error handling system ✅
- `40d0f49`: Dependency injection standardization ✅

## 🗂️ Key File Locations

### Configuration
- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code settings
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions and principles
- `config/requirements-v3.txt` - Current dependencies

### Critical Code Areas
- `app/services/` - Business logic (uses DI pattern)
- `app/ingestion/` - Needs TODO cleanup
- `scripts/test_runner.py` - Main test orchestrator
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration

### Documentation
- `docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_V3.md` - Deployment guide
- `docs/testing/TESTING_GUIDE_V3.md` - Testing strategy
- `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE_v3.0.0.md` - Dev guide

## 🎨 Architectural Decisions

### Must Follow
1. **Docker-first**: All development uses containers
2. **Dependency Injection**: Use `get_*_service()` factories
3. **Testing Layers**: validation → unit → integration → e2e
4. **Error Handling**: Service-level with proper logging

### Never Do
1. Direct service instantiation (always use factories)
2. Business logic in route handlers
3. Bare exceptions without context
4. Global Python package installs

## 🔮 Context for Next Claude Instance

When you read this file in a new session:
1. Check test suite status first: `make test`
2. Review recent commits: `git log --oneline -20`
3. Check for new TODOs: `python scripts/find_code_smells.py`
4. Verify Docker health: `docker-compose ps`
5. Continue with "Immediate Tasks" section above

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Environment setup
make setup

# Run all tests
make test

# Start development
make dev

# Check environment
python scripts/validate_environment.py
```

## 🎨 Design System Maintenance Guidelines

### Design System v3.0 (Nielsen Norman Group Compliant)
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Comprehensive design language and architecture
- **Documentation**: See `docs/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md` and `docs/DESIGN_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Implementation**: Started with `static/css/core/tokens.css` and component library

### Maintenance Rules
1. **NEVER use magic numbers** - All values must come from design tokens
2. **Update ALL states** - Default, hover, active, focus, disabled, loading, error
3. **Test at ALL breakpoints** - Mobile (320px), Tablet (640px), Desktop (1024px), Wide (1440px)
4. **Maintain pixel perfection** - Use design tokens for spacing, sizing, colors
5. **Follow BEM naming** - `.block__element--modifier` pattern

### Before ANY UI Change
- [ ] Review design tokens in `static/css/core/tokens.css`
- [ ] Check component documentation in design files
- [ ] Implement all component states
- [ ] Test accessibility (4.5:1 contrast minimum)
- [ ] Verify responsive behavior
- [ ] Update visual regression tests
- [ ] Document changes in component library

### Quick Reference
```css
/* ALWAYS use tokens */
padding: var(--space-4);        /* ✓ Correct */
padding: 16px;                  /* ✗ Wrong */

/* Component structure */
.nav { }                        /* Block */
.nav__links { }                 /* Element */
.nav--mobile { }                /* Modifier */
```
