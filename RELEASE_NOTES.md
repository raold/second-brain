# Second Brain v4.0.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: August 2, 2025  
**Tag**: v4.0.0  
**Status**: Production Ready 🚀

## 🎉 Highlights

Second Brain v4.0.0 represents a major evolution in AI-assisted development, introducing a sophisticated memory layer that learns from your coding patterns and seamlessly integrates with your development workflow.

### Key Features

- 🧠 **AI Memory Layer**: Dual-system memory architecture powered by Cipher
- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Natural language search across all stored knowledge
- 🔄 **Cross-IDE Sync**: Share context between VS Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, and Warp
- 📊 **Vector Database**: Qdrant integration for scalable memory storage
- 🚀 **60% Faster Startup**: Optimized initialization and smart agent activation
- 🔒 **Enhanced Security**: Automated secret scanning and secure environment management

## 📦 What's New

### Cipher Integration
The star feature of v4.0.0 is the integration with [Cipher](https://github.com/campfirein/cipher), an open-source memory layer for AI coding agents created by the [Byterover](https://github.com/byterover) team:

- **System 1 Memory**: Captures programming concepts, patterns, and business logic
- **System 2 Memory**: Stores reasoning chains and decision processes
- **MCP Protocol**: Industry-standard Model Context Protocol for IDE integration
- **Team Knowledge**: Optional sharing of memories across development teams

### Warp Terminal Support
First-class support for Warp, the AI-powered terminal:

- Custom MCP server for semantic command understanding
- Context-aware debugging assistance
- Command pattern recognition and suggestions
- Integration with Warp's AI features

### Infrastructure Improvements

#### Cross-Platform Development
- Automatic platform detection (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Google Drive sync for seamless multi-machine development
- Platform-specific command generation
- UTF-8 encoding fixes for Windows

#### Simplified Architecture
- **80% code reduction**: From 500+ files to ~100
- **Single API version**: V2 only (removed V1)
- **Unified configuration**: One `.env` file instead of multiple
- **Mock database**: Optional PostgreSQL with fallback

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/raold/second-brain.git
cd second-brain

# 2. Run the automated setup
./scripts/install_cipher.sh

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys:
# - OPENAI_API_KEY
# - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (optional)

# 4. Start services
docker-compose up -d  # Starts PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant
cipher api &          # Starts Cipher memory server
make dev             # Starts Second Brain API
```

### IDE Configuration

#### Warp Terminal
1. Open Warp Settings → MCP Servers
2. Add the configuration from `warp-mcp-config.json`
3. Update with your OpenAI API key
4. Restart Warp

#### Claude Desktop
Already configured! Just restart Claude Desktop after installation.

#### VS Code / Cursor
Install the MCP extension from marketplace - auto-detects Cipher.

## 📊 System Requirements

- **Node.js**: v18+ (for Cipher)
- **Python**: 3.9+ (for Second Brain)
- **Docker**: For PostgreSQL, Redis, and Qdrant
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 2GB for base installation + vector storage

## 🔄 Migration from v3.x

### Breaking Changes
1. API endpoints changed from `/api/v1/*` to `/api/v2/*`
2. Environment files consolidated (`.env.development`, `.env.staging` → `.env`)
3. Some synthesis services are now stubs (to be reimplemented)

### Migration Steps
```bash
# 1. Backup your data
pg_dump your_db > backup.sql

# 2. Update environment variables
mv .env.development .env
# Remove old env files

# 3. Install Cipher
./scripts/install_cipher.sh

# 4. Setup Qdrant collections
python scripts/setup_qdrant_cipher.py

# 5. Restart services
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```
